# INTER-LAN COMMIT LEDGER

Target: **300+ meaningful commits per active phase**.

No fake commits. No whitespace farming. No empty commits.

## Historical

| Phase | Status | Preserved granular target |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| P0 | Accepted, squash-merged | historical exception |
| P1 | Accepted, squash-merged | historical exception |

## Active campaign

| Phase | Target | Current | Status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| P2 | 300+ | 100 commits ahead of accepted main after this architecture-review commit | active — C100 replay required |
| P3 | 300+ | 0 | blocked on accepted P2 merge |
| P4 | 300+ | 0 | not started |
| P5 | 300+ | 0 | not started |
| P6 | 300+ | 0 | not started |
| P7 | 300+ | 0 | not started |

P2 accepted predecessor:

`main@91c010dd3bd448fc9bd5ec9159e94262569e3e79`

P2 C075 source checkpoint:

`926ffffdbc437a85ebb1c9109ee85acc2a524383`

The two repository-state/ledger commits immediately after that checkpoint are part of the meaningful phase history.

## Checkpoints

- C025: passed by implementation history before formal campaign ledger.
- C050: crossed during structural hardening wave; superseded by immediate C075 local replay.
- C075: **PASS — operator-local Windows replay at `3a1805fb7c985b83ca72bd2c6f4353abcc435f1e`.**
- C100: **ARCHITECTURE REVIEW ISSUED — LOCAL REPLAY REQUIRED.**
- C125: focused phase checkpoint.
- C150: restart/persistence/migration replay.
- C175: focused phase checkpoint.
- C200: architecture/invariant review.
- C225: focused phase checkpoint.
- C250: restart/persistence/migration replay.
- C275: focused phase checkpoint.
- C300: full phase acceptance.

## C075 local replay result

PASS:
- full solution build;
- P1 identity/pairing;
- P1 real HTTPS network smoke;
- P2 core DM/persistence;
- P2 realtime/pairing/rotation/revocation.

C075 is closed.

## Current completed slices

- pairing/session persistence;
- DM persistence/realtime/catch-up;
- SQLite concurrency baseline;
- rate-limit partition foundation;
- realtime revocation plumbing;
- recipient receipt semantics;
- multi-device identity;
- credential rotation lifecycle;
- canonical runtime settings foundation;
- reusable server-host integration spine;
- verification solution topology;
- shared process/network testing foundation.

## C100 source authority

`bc56986096f4e40690f8bb35ebfb3d7666363450`

C075→C100 completed:
1. shared-harness migration for P1 network smoke;
2. DM concurrency/idempotency hardening;
3. rate-limit partition proof;
4. historical migration fixtures and upgrade checks;
5. aggregate local suite runner;
6. desktop in-process owner-host lifecycle proof.

C100 replay command:
`dotnet build InterLan.sln -c Release`
then
`dotnet run --project tools/InterLan.SuiteChecks/InterLan.SuiteChecks.csproj -c Release --no-build`

Do not advance into another large wave until this replay is clean.

## Ledger rule

After each coherent implementation wave, update:
- current phase commit count;
- latest head;
- last completed slice;
- next slice;
- known blocker count;
- last local checkpoint result.

Do not rewrite prior accepted ledger history.
